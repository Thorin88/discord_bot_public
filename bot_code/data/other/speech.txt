No... Always you... Can't you just let it be, World Guardian?
I'll tear right through you.
I will put you in your place.
You will break beneath me.
Your godly devotion won't save you here, Player.
Witness the raw power of the Staff.
No. I control the threads of time.
The time threads have split!
I... can... contain... ALL. ITS. POWER.
The time threads have split!
If the needle won't heed my command. Then I'll use a greater weapon. The staff of Armadyl.
Look at what you've done! You've fractured the threads of time!
We did it! He's dead!
NO! Let me die! JUST LET ME DIE!
Pitiful.
Inevitable.
We will all be free.
Your timeline ends here.
